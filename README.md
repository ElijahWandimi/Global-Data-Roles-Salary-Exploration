The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here]([link-to-kaggle-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aijobs/global-salaries-in-ai-ml-data-science)). 


The notebook provides clear descriptions of the findings in every step and can be easily followed by non-programmers. <br>
Eg;
  
  > Most of the data roles in Europe and the USA generally pay higher than those in Africa and Asia,
  > with most managerial roles recorded in Europe and the US.
